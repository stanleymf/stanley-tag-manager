- No customer data is stored permanently
- Access tokens are never exposed in frontend code

## üìä Performance

- **Fast Loading**: Leverages Cloudflare's global edge network
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Shopify's API limits (40 req/sec)
- **Efficient Batching**: Groups operations to minimize API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically retries failed operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to load segments"**

- Ensure the Private App has correct scopes

**"Failed to apply tags"**
- Confirm `write_customers` scope is enabled
- Check that the Private App is active
- Verify customer IDs are valid

**Rate Limit Errors**
